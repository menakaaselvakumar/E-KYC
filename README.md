## ABSTRACT 
Electronic-Know Your Customer(E-kyc) processing is basically a time consuming and excruciating process because each employees personal details have to be checked manually, cross checked, send for approval and so on. The entire process take time and is prone to errors due to multiple levels of human scrutiny. Generating the KYC for every employees can be handed over to a RPA solution which can do this activity automatically and without even any manual intervention during the process.The system is planned to be built using UI path studio and triggered using UiPath Robot
 
## MODULE SPLITUP
<li>Module 1 : Collecting Candidates details(Menakaa S U)</li>
<li>Module 2 : PDF Automation(Menakaa S U)</li>
<li>Module 3 : Creating a website to upload the files(Suwetha B)</li>
<li>Module 4 : E-mail automation(Mohammed Thansir A)</li>

## PROPOSED SYSTEM
Proposed System is planned to implement using the RPA tools. The business file(i.e.Excel sheet) is given as the input to the bot. Separate template has been generated to write the candidates personal details. The informations which are stored in the Excel sheet has been read and is written in the word template. Then the word template has been exported to pdf. The pdf files has been stored in the separate folder, so that the pdf can be used whenever is it necessary. Separate website has been created to fill the form automatically. Then the submitted form has been stored in separate folder and the link is being given to the agent for their verification.

## ADVANTAGES OF PROPOSED SYSTEM
  •	Its takes less time to complete the whole process.
  •	No manual intervention is needed.
  
## FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS 	 
 	This project is focused on robot that performs the fetching and filling  operations by constraints that are defined by human and sending mails to that particular candidates. The future enhancements can be done by using the Uipath activities. The bot should get the notifications, if mails are not send to the particular  candidates which are mentioned in the input files.
